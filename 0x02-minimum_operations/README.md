Problem Breakdown

We start with a single character 'H' in our file
We have two operations: "Copy All" and "Paste"
"Copy All" copies all characters in the file to the clipboard
"Paste" appends whatever is in the clipboard to the file
We need to reach exactly n characters with the minimum number of operations

Key insights:

We need to determine the optimal pattern of copying and pasting
When we do a "Copy All", we're essentially setting up to multiply our current count
The most efficient approach will involve breaking down n into factors

Mathematical Approach
This is a prime factorization problem. Let me explain why:

The most efficient way to reach a number n is to break it down into multiplications
Each time we want to multiply our current count, we need to do "Copy All" followed by one or more "Paste" operations
For each prime factor p of n, we need p operations (1 "Copy All" + (p-1) "Paste")

For example, with n = 9:

9 = 3 Ã— 3
For the first factor of 3: Start with 'H', "Copy All", "Paste", "Paste" (3 operations to get 'HHH')
For the second factor of 3: "Copy All", "Paste", "Paste" (3 operations to get 'HHHHHHHHH')
Total: 6 operations
